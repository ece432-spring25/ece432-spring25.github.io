    </ul>

    <h5 class="mt-5">Introduction</h5>
    <p>In this assignment, you will add functionality to the code you wrote for <a
        href="../random/index.html">Assignment 1</a>, toward the goal of implementing a secure facility for
      client-server communication across the Internet.</p>

    <p>As before, we will give you some of the code you need, and we will ask you to provide certain functions missing
      from the code we provide. As before, you must not use any cryptography libraries; the only cryptographic
      primitives you may use are the ones we gave you, and ones you implemented from scratch yourself.</p>

    <p>In this assignment you will implement three classes, by modifying three Java code files:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> You will modify <code>RSAKeyPair.java</code> to implement RSA key-pair generation.</li>
      <li> You will modify <code>RSAKey.java</code> to implement secure RSA encryption and decryption, and to create and
        verify digital signatures.</li>
      <li> You will modify <code>KeyExchange.java</code> to implement secure key exchange.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As in the previous assignment, we have provided you with code files in which some parts are <em>stubbed out</em>.
      You will replace the stubbed out pieces with code that actually works and provides the required security
      guarantee. We have put a comment saying <code>IMPLEMENT THIS</code> everywhere that you have to supply code.</p>

    <p>Your solution will build on the functionality that you implemented for Assignment 1, but we will test your
      solution with our own implementation of the Assignment 1 functionality. Your solution must work correctly when we
      do this — this shouldn’t be a problem as long as you respect the API boundaries between the different classes we
      have given you. To help you mimic the testing setup that we will use, we are providing a pre-compiled JAR file
      (library) containing our reference solution to Assignment 1. We recommend that you use this instead of your own
      solution to Assignment 1.</p>

    <h5 class="mt-5">Objectives</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand how asymmetric cryptography works.</li>
    </ul>


    <h5 class="mt-5">RSAKeyPair.java</h5>
    <p>Your RSAKeyPair class should implement the following API:</p>
    <code><pre>
public class RSAKeyPair {
   public RSAKeyPair(PRGen rand, int numBits)
   public RSAKey getPublicKey()                 // already implemented
   public RSAKey getPrivateKey()                // already implemented
   public BigInteger[] getPrimes()
}</pre></code>

    <p>For <code>RSAKeyPair</code>, the bulk of the interesting work is performed by the constructor. This constructor
      should create an RSA key pair using the algorithm discussed in class. The constructor will use the
      <code>PRGen rand</code> argument to get bits from a pseudo-random generator. The <code>numBits</code> argument is
      the size in bits of each of the primes that will be used. The key pair should be stored as a pair of
      <code>RSAKey</code> objects (see next section for more information on <code>RSAKey</code>).
    </p>

    <p>The <code>getPrimes()</code> method helps with the grading process. Invoking <code>getPrimes()</code> should
      return the two primes that were used in key generation. The primes may be returned in either order in a
      <code>BigInteger</code> array of length 2. Note that in the real-world implementation, you would not need to have
      a method to return these primes.
    </p>



    <h5 class="mt-5">RSAKey.java</h5>
    <p>Your RSAKey class should implement the following API:</p>
    <code><pre>
public class RSAKey {
   public RSAKey(BigInteger theExponent, BigInteger theModulus)
   public BigInteger getExponent()
   public BigInteger getModulus()
   public byte[] encrypt(byte[] plaintext, PRGen prgen)
   public byte[] decrypt(byte[] ciphertext)
   public byte[] sign(byte[] message, PRGen prgen)
   public boolean verifySignature(byte[] message, byte[] signature)
   public int maxPlaintextLength()
   public byte[] encodeOaep(byte[] input, PRGen prgen)
   public byte[] decodeOaep(byte[] input)
   public byte[] addPadding(byte[] input)
   public byte[] removePadding(byte[] input)
}</pre></code>

    <p>The <code>RSAKey</code> class implements core RSA functions, namely encryption/decryption as well as
      signing/verification. Note that the <code>RSAKey</code> class is used for both public and private keys, even
      though some key/method combinations are unlikely to be used in practice. For example, it is unlikely that the
      <code>sign()</code> method of a public <code>RSAKey</code> would ever be used.
    </p>
    <p>The primary interface for this class includes the <code>sign()</code>, <code>verifySignature()</code>,
      <code>encrypt()</code>, <code>decrypt()</code>, and <code>maxPlaintextLength()</code>
      methods. The remaining methods are to help keep the code organized and easier to grade. Each method is commented
      to help you understand its purpose and requirements.
    </p>
    <p>Note that the <code>encrypt()</code>, <code>sign()</code>, and <code>encodeOaep()</code> methods take a
      <code>PRGen</code> object as a parameter, in case the implementation wants to use bits from a pseudo-random
      generator.
    </p>
    <p>The <code>sign()</code> method should generate a signature (array of bytes) that can be verified by the
      <code>verifySignature()</code> method of the other RSAKey in the private/public RSAKey pair. Recall that an RSA
      signature does not have a length limit. In the
      <code>sign()</code> method, you should not include the message as part of the signature; assume that the verifier
      will already have access to this message. This assumption of access is reflected in the API for
      <code>verifySignature()</code>, which accepts the message as one of its arguments.
    </p>
    <p>The <code>encrypt()</code> method should encrypt the plain text using optimal asymmetric encryption padding
      (OAEP) as discussed in class. It is not enough to simply compute modular exponentiation on the plain text. The
      <code>decrypt()</code> method should correctly recover the plaintext from the ciphertext (if it hasn’t been
      corrupted). These methods will call the other helper functions to do this job.
    </p>
    <p> Your code for OAEP encoding and decoding should be in the provided <code>encodeOaep()</code> and
      <code>decodeOaep()</code> methods. When decoding an OAEP message, your code should verify the message’s integrity.
      If the message shows signs of corruption, then your <code>decodeOaep()</code> should reveal this by returning null
      or throwing an
      exception. For full credit, don’t forget to pad the input to the OAEP algorithm if it is too short – this is
      necessary to guarantee security (otherwise the exponentiated message might be smaller than the modulus).
    </p>
    <p>OAEP encoding requires that its input be a fixed length determined by the RSA key’s parameters.
      The <code>addPadding()</code> and <code>removePadding()</code> methods should implement a reversible padding
      scheme to ensure that messages are the correct length before being encoded. <em>You should not call these methods
        from within <code>encodeOAEP()</code> and <code>decodeOAEP().</code></em>
    </p>
    <p>The <code>maxPlaintextLength()</code> method should return the largest \(\ell\) such that any plain text of size
      \(\ell\) bytes can be encrypted with this key and padding scheme. Pay very close attention to this method, as it
      must consider the key size, the OAEP encoding, and the padding scheme. Calculate this value such that the input to
      RSA modular exponentiation is always <b><em>less than</em></b> the RSA modulus. Your code must correctly operate
      on plain texts
      that are any size less than or equal to the size returned by <code>maxPlaintextLength()</code>.</p>

    <h5 class="mt-5">KeyExchange.java</h5>
    <p>Your KeyExchange class should implement the following API:</p>
    <code><pre>
public class KeyExchange {
   public static final int OUTPUT_SIZE_BYTES
   public static final int OUTPUT_SIZE_BITS
   public KeyExchange(PRGen rand, boolean iAmServer)
   public byte[] prepareOutMessage()
   public byte[] processInMessage(byte[] inMessage)
}</pre></code>

    <p>The constructor should prepare to do a Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange. The <code>rand</code> argument is a secure
      pseudo-random generator that can be used by the implementation. The <code>iAmServer</code> argument is true if and
      only if that
      object is the server role of a client-server interaction. Each “exchange” will have two participants: a client and
      a server. This means two parties (e.g., computers, threads, servers) will create one <code>KeyExchange</code>
      object each. In our automated testing, we will use the <code>iAmServer</code> boolean
      as a flag to indicate which object belongs to which role. You may not need to use the <code>iAmServer</code>
      argument in your implementation, but it may be helpful for debugging.</p>
    <p>After two <code>KeyExchange</code> objects are instantiated, two things have to happen for the key exchange process to be
      complete:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Invoke the <code>prepareOutMessage</code> method on this object, and send the result to the other participant.
      </li>
      <li>Receive the result of the other participant’s <code>prepareOutMessage</code>, and pass it in as the argument
        to a call on this object’s <code>processInMessage</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These two things can happen in either order, or even concurrently (e.g., in different threads). This
      code must work correctly regardless of the order.</p>
    <p>The call to <code>processInMessage</code> should behave as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>If passed a null value, then throw a <code>NullPointerException</code>. </li>
      <li>If passed a invalid/insecure Diffie-Hellman exchanged message, return <code>null</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, return a <em>digest</em> (hashed) value with length <code>OUTPUT_SIZE_BYTES</code> and the property
        described below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your <code>KeyExchange</code> class must provide the following security guarantee: If the two participants end up
      with the same non-null digest value, then this digest value is not known to anyone else. This must be true even if
      adversaries can observe and modify the messages sent between the participants.</p>

    <p>This code is <em>not</em> required to check whether the two participants end up with the same digest value; the
      code calling this must verify that property.</p>

    <h5 class="mt-5">Getting Started</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>As in Assignment 1, the specification is deliberately vague regarding how you should accomplish each task.
        There is a significant design component to each problem.</li>
      <li>Read all of the comments and code annotations in the provided Java files (including helper files). Being
        familiar with this framework will be very helpful before you get started.</li>
      <li>Use <code>BigInteger</code>:
        <ul>
          <li>Since you will be doing math with very large integers, you will probably want to use the <a
              href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigInteger.html">java.math.BigInteger</a>
            library class for any such operations. This class provides myriad functions that you may find useful for
            this assignment, particularly as <code>BigInteger</code> was originally designed with RSA implementation in
            mind. (Using <code>BigInteger</code> doesn’t violate our rule against using external cryptographic
            primitives, because <code>BigInteger</code> provides basic mathematical functions, and not cryptography.)
          </li>
          <li>If you find yourself writing complex functions involving <code>BigIntegers</code> (e.g., manually testing
            primality, manually generating primes, manually finding the greatest common denominator of two numbers,
            manually finding \(d\) given \(p\), \(q\), and \(e\), etc.), you are doing way more work than you need to.
            Find the appropriate <code>BigInteger</code> method.</li>
          <li>Converting back and forth between <code>BigInteger</code> objects and <code>byte[]</code> arrays is a
            major hassle. It’s surprisingly hard to get this code right. We have provided code in the
            <code>HW2Util.java</code> file that can do this.
          </li>
          <li>For maximum elegance in <code>RSAKey</code>, your message should only be in <code>BigInteger</code> format
            for the purposes of exponentiating and modulusing. In other words, when you are applying OAEP, padding,
            unOAEP, etc., it is much easier to deal with your input in terms of <code>byte[]</code> arrays.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Review the properties and implementation requirements for a secure Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange and consider
        the case of concurrent participants. Implementing <code>KeyExchange.java</code> is independent of the RSA
        components of this assignment, and can be done at any point.</li>
      <li>Review the requirements and algorithm for generating RSA key pairs, including special cases and properties of
        intermediate values. You should implement and test <code>RSAKeyPair.java</code> before diving into
        <code>RSAKey.java</code>, since you will want to make sure you are using correctly generated RSA key exponents
        and moduli when testing your RSA keys.
      </li>
      <li>When implementing RSAKey.java, it may be beneficial to implement it incrementally:
        <ul>
          <li>Modular exponentiation on fixed-length inputs (<code>encrypt</code> and <code>decrypt</code>).</li>
          <li>OAEP encoding/decoding on fixed-length inputs (<code>encodeOaep</code> and <code>decodeOAEP</code>).</li>
          <li>Combining modular exponentiation and OAEP on fixed-length inputs.</li>
          <li>Reversible padding in <code>addPadding</code> and <code>removePadding</code>.</li>
          <li>Determining an equation for <code>maximumPlaintextLength</code> and combining all the stages: pad ->
            encode -> exponentiate -> exponentiate -> decode -> un-pad. This will take some time to test and debug.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Given private and public keys \((d, N)\) and \((e, N)\), we have that \(x = (x^{(de)}\ mod\ N)\), if \(0 < x <
          N\). Thus, if you are going to use the built-in <code>BigInteger</code> methods to encrypt and decrypt, it is
          important that you represent your input message as a positive <code>BigInteger</code>.</li>
      <li>An <code>RSAKey</code> object does not know if it is <em>private</em> or <em>public</em> key. Indeed, it is
        even possible to sign messages using a public key or encrypt using a private key, though neither of these
        strange operations are likely to be useful in practice.</li>
      <li>We recommend that first you get your code working for the case where all inputs are full sized, then modify
        your code so that it handles padding. When you implement padding, the relevant code should be in the provided
        <code>addPadding()</code> and <code>removePadding()</code> methods. Your other methods should call these utility
        methods to pad/unpad when necessary.
      </li>
      </ol>

    </ul>

    <h5 class="mt-5">Java Command Line Tips</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Always make sure to run your code with the <code>java -ea</code> flag, so that assertions are enabled.</li>
      <li>If your are confident that your solution to Assignment 1 is correct, you could use those <code>.java</code>
        files for testing your implementation of Assignment 2. Alternatively, you can use our reference solution to
        Assignment 1, which is provided a pre-compiled JAR file (library). Note that this library does not contain
        source code. Attempting to “de-compile” this JAR file may constitute academic misconduct. To compile and execute
        your Assignment 2 code using the JAR file, you need to include it in your
        classpath.
        <br />
        For example, using Linux/Mac command line, you may run:
        <code><pre>
$ javac -cp hw1.jar KeyExchange.java
$ java -ea -cp hw1.jar:. KeyExchange
</pre></code>
        For Windows command line, you may run:
        <code><pre>
$ javac -cp "hw1.jar" KeyExchange.java
$ java -ea -cp "hw1.jar;." KeyExchange
</pre></code>
        If you are testing and running using an IDE, please refer to the IDE's user manual on how to add
        <code>.jar </code> files to the classpath.
      </li>
