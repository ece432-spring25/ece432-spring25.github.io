      <li class="list-inline-item"><a class="social-icon text-xs-center" target="_blank"
          href="cos432-forensics.zip">Download Files &dArr;</a></li>

    </ul>

    <h5 class="mt-5">Introduction</h5>
    <p>
      In this project, you will play the role of a forensic analyst who is investigating a murder. The
      accused is Bob, who has fled the country and disappeared. Officers have seized a disk image of
      Bobâ€™s computer. </p>
    <p>
      Your job is to conduct a forensic examination of a disk image and document any evidence related to
      the murder. If you find sufficient evidence, a case can be brought against Bob. </p>



    <h5 class="mt-5">Objectives</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand how computer use can leave persistent traces and why such evidence is often
        difficult to remove or conceal.</li>
      <li>Gain experience applying the security mindset to investigate computer misuse and intrusion.</li>
      <li>Learn how to retrieve information from a disk image without booting the operating system,
        and understand why this is necessary to preserve forensic integrity.</li>
    </ul>


    <h5 class="mt-5">Getting Started</h5>
    <p>
      The <a href="forensics_instructions.pdf">Forensics VM Instructions for x86</a> document contains step-by-step
      instructions to set up the virtual
      machine and analyze the forensics disk image. If your device uses an ARM chip like the M1 Mac, you should follow
      the instructions in the <a href="forensics_instructions_m1.pdf">Forensics VM Instructions for M1 Macs</a>
      document. </p>

    <h5 class="mt-5"> Tasks and Deliverables </h5>
    <p> You will provide an answer file <code>tokens.txt</code>, together with a directory <code> evidence/</code>
      containing all relevant evidence you discover. Your answers should be <i>complete</i> but <i>concise</i>. You may
      use the directory template that we have provided you <a href="cos432-forensics.zip">here</a>.</p>

    <p> <b><code>tokens.txt</code></b> As you complete the investigation, you will encounter "tokens" that represent major steps
      or important files. Most of the tokens are a string of words at the end of a file, separated by a single character each.
      Other tokens are simply passwords or monetary transaction identifiers. Place these in <code>tokens.txt</code>, separated by newlines. 
      <b> For each token you find, please also write 2-3 sentences briefly explaining how you obtain the token.</b> 
      This file will be the bulk of your assignment grade. To receive full credit, you'll need to submit the following tokens:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>At least 1 password</li>
      <li>At least 6 (out of 9) two-word tokens</li>
      <li>At least 3 (out of 4) three-word tokens</li>
      <li>At least 2 (out of 4) transaction ID (limit 1) or four-word tokens</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b><code>evidence/</code></b> Whenever you find a piece of evidence (e.g., a token), you must include a file or screenshot
      demonstrating where you found it. This directory should contain things like files containing tokens, screenshots of where you 
      found a token, programs you wrote to crack passwords, etc. You should not need more than one file in this directory per token you found.</p>

    <h5 class="mt-5">Useful Links</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../netsec/vm_instructions.pdf">VM instructions</a></li>
      <li><a href="forensics_instructions.pdf">Forensics VM Instructions (x86)</a></li>
      <li><a href="forensics_instructions_m1.pdf">Forensics VM Instructions (ARM / M1 Macs)</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="mt-5"> Policies and Hints </h5>
    <p><b>Collaboration outside of your group</b> is strictly limited to conceptual topics discussed in lecture.
      Much of this assignment is focused on a group exploring possibilities and trying things themselves.
      The number of pieces of evidence you find, the techniques you try, how successful said techniques are,
      the general process you follow, etc. are all considered part of your solution and must not be discussed with
      members of other groups. You are free to search online for generic techniques and tutorials so long as you respect the
      collaboration policy of this course and cite all sources.

    <p> <b>Cracking passwords</b> is a required task in this project. It is sufficient to bruteforce these passwords (i.e., guess and check).
      It is highly recommended you use <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/h3xx/1976236/raw/bbabb412261386673eff521dddbe1dc815373b1d/wiki-100k.txt">this dictionary</a>
      for these bruteforcing attacks. Any bruteforcing you do in this assignment should not take more than a few hours.
      If anything you run exceeds this, let us know on Ed and we can confirm whether you are on the right track.</p>

    <p><b>Network attacks</b> are <em>not</em> required in this project. You should not conduct any network attacks.
      Other than using online informational resources, you do not even need an internet connection to complete this project.
    </p>
    <h5 class="mt-5">Submission Checklist</h5>
    <p>Submit your files as a single zip file to <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>. Make sure you
      select all your group members when submitting. The zip file should contain the files / directories below:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
      <li>&#9633; <code>tokens.txt</code> - A plain text file with your discovered tokens and brief explanations of how
        you discovered them. </li>
      <li>&#9633; <code>evidence/</code> - A directory containing any recovered file(s).</li>
    </ul>
