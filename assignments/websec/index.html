    </ul>

    <h5 class="mt-5">Introduction</h5>
    <p>In this assignment, we provide an insecure website, and your job is to attack it by exploiting three common
      classes of vulnerabilities: SQL injection, cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and cross-site scripting (XSS). You
      are also asked to exploit these problems with various flawed defenses in place. Understanding how these attacks
      work will help you better defend your own web applications.</p>

    <p> This is a group assignment, and must be done in groups of 2 or 3 only.</p>

    <h5 class="mt-5">Objectives</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn to spot common vulnerabilities in websites and to avoid them in your own projects.</li>
      <li>Understand the risks these problems pose and the weaknesses of naive defenses.</li>
      <li>Gain experience with web architecture and with HTML, JavaScript, and SQL programming.</li>
    </ul>


    <h5 class="mt-5">Read This First</h5>
    <p>
      This project asks you to perform attacks, with our permission, against a target website that we are
      providing for this purpose. Attempting the same kinds of attacks against other websites without
      authorization is prohibited by law and university policies. You must not attack any website without authorization!
      Per course policy, you are
      required to respect the privacy and property rights of others at all times. See <a
        href="https://rrr.princeton.edu/">“Right, Rules, and Responsibilities”</a> on the Princeton University website
      for more
      details.
    </p>
    <h5></h5>
    <h5 class="mt-5">Target Website</h5>
    <p>A startup named <b>BUNGLE!</b> is about to launch its first product — a web search engine — but their investors
      are nervous about security problems. Unlike the Bunglers who developed the site, you took COS 432, so the
      investors have hired you to perform a security evaluation before it goes live.</p>

    <p><b>BUNGLE!</b> is available for you to test at <a href="https://elecos432.org">https://elecos432.org</a>.</p>

    <p>The site is written in Python using the <a href="https://bottlepy.org/">Bottle web framework</a>. Although Bottle
      has built-in mechanisms that help guard against some common vulnerabilities, the Bunglers have circumvented or
      ignored these mechanisms in several places.</p>

    <p>In addition to providing search results, the site accepts logins and tracks users’ search histories. It stores
      usernames, passwords, and search history in a MySQL database. Before being granted access to the source code, you
      reverse engineered the site and determined that it replies to five main URLs:
    <ul style="list-style: none; ">
      <li><code>/</code></li>
      <li><code>/search</code></li>
      <li><code>/login</code></li>
      <li><code>/logout</code></li>
      <li><code>/create</code></li>
    </ul>
    The function of these URLs is explained below, but if you want an additional challenge, you can skip the rest of
    this section and do the reverse engineering yourself.</p>
    <p>
    <ul style="list-style: none; ">
      <li><b>Main page</b> (<code>/</code>) The main page accepts <code>GET</code> requests and displays a search form.
        When submitted,this form issues a <code>GET</code> request to <code>/search</code>, sending the search string as
        the parameter “q”.
        <br>If no user is logged in, the main page also displays a form that gives the user the option of logging in or
        creating an account. The form issues <code>POST</code> requests to /login and /create.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li><b>Search results</b> (<code>/search</code>) The search results page accepts GET requests and prints the
        search string, supplied in the “q” query parameter, along with the search results. If the user is logged in, the
        page also displays the user’s recent search history in a sidebar.
        <br>
        Note: Since actual search is not relevant to this project, you might not receive any results.
      </li>
      <p></p>

      <li><b>Login handler</b> (<code>/login</code>) The login handler accepts <code>POST</code> requests and takes
        plaintext “username” and “password” query parameters. It checks the user database to see if a user with those
        credentials exists. If so, it sets a login cookie and redirects the browser to the main page. The cookie tracks
        which user is logged in; manipulating or forging it is not part of this project.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li><b>Logout handler</b> (<code>/logout</code>) The logout handler accepts <code>POST</code> requests. It deletes
        the login cookie,if set, and redirects the browser to the main page.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li><b>Create account handler</b> (<code>/create</code>) The create account handler accepts <code>POST</code>
        requests and receives plaintext “username” and “password” query parameters. It inserts the username and password
        into the database of users, unless a user with that username already exists. It then logs the user in and
        redirects the browser to the main page.
        <br></br>
        Note: The password is neither sent nor stored securely; however, none of the attacks you implement should depend
        on this behavior. You should choose a username and password that other groups will not guess, but never use an
        important password to test an insecure site (in general, you shouldn't reuse any passwords)!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="mt-5">Guidelines</h5>
    <p>
      <b>Virtual Machine:</b> For this project, we’d like you to do all your testing within the VM that you used for
      Assignment 4. This VM provides Firefox (the browser we will use for grading is the same version) and a method for
      hosting a local HTTP server (necessary for Part 3). Browser versions have slight variations in their behavior that
      may affect your XSS and CSRF attacks, so we highly recommend that you develop and test your solutions within the
      VM.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Firefox Configuration:</b> Firefox implements <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/State_Partitioning>
      dynamic state partitioning</a> which makes pulling off CSRF (part 2) considerably difficult.
      In order to make things feasible, while grading, we will use Firefox 111.0.1 running on Ubuntu 20.04 and
      set the <i>network.cookie.cookieBehavior</i> config variable to 4 (Only reject trackers), all other variables and settings
      will be at their default values. When using the VM, you will find that Firefox automatically updates to the latest version.
      That is ok and you should be able to work on the assignment as expected if you set the  <i>network.cookie.cookieBehavior</i>
      config variable. To do so, please follow these instructions on <a href=https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-config-editor-firefox>
      editing config variables</a>.
      Note that this change will not affect your solutions to parts 1 and 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Defense Levels:</b> The Bunglers have been experimenting with some naïve defenses, so you also need to
      demonstrate that these provide insufficient protection. In Parts 2 and 3, the site includes drop-down menus at the
      top of each page that let you change the CSRF and XSS defenses that are in use. The solutions you submit must
      override these selections by including the <code>csrfdefense=n</code> or <code>xssdefense=n</code> parameter in
      the target URL, as specified in each task below. <b>You may not attempt to subvert the mechanism for changing the
        level of defense in your attacks.</b> Be sure to test your solutions with the appropriate defense levels!
    </p>

    <p>In all parts, you should implement the simplest attack you can think of that defeats the given set of defenses.
      In other words, do not simply attack the highest level of defense and submit that attack as your solution for all
      defenses. You do not need to combine the vulnerabilities, unless explicitly stated.
    </p>


    <p>
      <b>Resources:</b> The Firefox web developer tools will be very helpful for this project, particularly the
      JavaScript console and debugger, DOM inspector, and network monitor. To open these tools, click the Developer
      button in the Firefox menu. See <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools</a>. Note
      that there is also a special version of the browser called Firefox Developer Edition; you’re welcome to use it to
      develop and test, but we will be grading with the normal edition of Firefox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your solutions will involve manipulating SQL statements and writing web code using HTML, JavaScript, and the
      jQuery library. You should search the web for answers to basic how-to questions. There are many fine online
      resources for learning these tools. Here are a few that we recommend:</p>

    <h5 class="mt-5">Getting Started</h5>
    <p> Download the directory template <a href="cos432-websec.zip">here</a>. You should be using this to organize your
      answers. For most of the questions, you can simply type up the answer in the text/html files we've created for
      you. However, for 1.2, make sure you replace the placeholder zip archive with your own zip file that contains all
      the source code.</p>

    <h5 class="mt-5">Part 1. SQL Injection</h5>
    <p>
      Your first goal is to demonstrate SQL injection attacks that log you in as an arbitrary user without knowing the
      password. In order to protect other students’ accounts, we’ve made a series of separate login forms for you to
      attack that aren’t part of the main <b>BUNGLE!</b> site. For each of the following defenses, provide inputs to the
      target login form that successfully log you in as the user “victim”:
    </p>
    <ol start="0">
      <li><b>No defenses</b>
        <br>
        Target: <a href="https://elecos432.org/sqlinject0/">https://elecos432.org/sqlinject0/</a>
        <br>
        Submit: sql_0.txt
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li><b>Simple escaping</b>
        <br>
        The server escapes single quotes (') in the inputs by replacing them with two single quotes.
        <br>
        Target: <a href="https://elecos432.org/sqlinject1/">https://elecos432.org/sqlinject1/</a>
        <br>
        Submit: sql_1.txt
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li><b>Escaping and Hashing</b>
        <br>
        The server uses the following PHP code, which escapes the username and applies the MD5 hash function to the
        password:
        <code><pre>
	        if (isset($_POST['username']) and isset($_POST['password'])) {
               $username = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['username']);
               $password = md5($_POST['password'], true);
               $sql_s = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username' and pw='$password'";
               $rs = mysql_query($sql_s);
               if (mysql_num_rows($rs) > 0) {
                  echo "Login successful!";
               } else {
                  echo "Incorrect username or password";
               }
            }</pre></code>
        This is more difficult than the previous two defenses. You will need to write a program to
        produce a working exploit. You can use any language you like, but we recommend Python for its ease in library
        linking.
        <br>
        Target: <a href="https://elecos432.org/sqlinject2/">https://elecos432.org/sqlinject2/</a> <br />
        Submit: sql_2.txt and sql_2_src.zip (zip archive of the program files that you wrote)
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li><b>The SQL (extra credit)</b>
        <br>
        This target uses a different database. Your job is to use SQL injection to retrieve:
        <ol start="a">
          <li>The name of the database</li>
          <li>The version of the SQL server</li>
          <li>All of the names of the tables in the database</li>
          <li>A secret string hidden in the database</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        Target: <a href="https://elecos432.org/sqlinject3/">https://elecos432.org/sqlinject3/</a>
        <br>
        Submit: sql_3.txt
        <br>
        For this part, the text file you submit should starts with a list of the URLs for all the queries you made to
        learn the answers. After the list of the URLs, show the values of the database name, SQL server version, names
        of tables and a secret string using this format:
        <br>
        <code><pre>
          URL
          URL
          URL
          ...
          Name: DB name
          Version: DB version string
          Tables: comma separated names
          Secret: secret string</pre></code>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>
      <b>What to submit</b> For 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, when you successfully log in as victim, the server will provide a
      URL-encoded version of your form inputs. Submit a text file with the specified filename containing only this line.
      For 1.2, also submit the source code for the program you wrote, as a zip file (sql_2_src.zip). For 1.3, submit a
      text file as specified.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-5">Part 2. Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)</h5>
    <p>Your next task is to demonstrate CSRF vulnerabilities against the login form, and <b>BUNGLE!</b> has
      provided two variations of their implementation for you to test. Your goal is to construct attacks that
      surreptitiously cause the victim to log in to an account you control, thus allowing you to monitor
      the victim’s search queries by viewing the search history for this account. For each of the defenses
      below, create an HTML file that, when opened by a victim, logs their browser into <b>BUNGLE!</b> under
      the account <code>attacker</code> and password <code>l33th4x</code>.</p>

    <p>
      Your solutions should not display evidence of an attack; the browser should just display a blank page.
(If the victim later visits <b>BUNGLE!</b>, it will say “logged in as attacker”, but that’s fine for purposes of
the project. After all, most users won’t immediately notice.)</p>
    <ul start="0">
      <li><b>No defenses</b>
        <br>
        Target: https://elecos432.org/login?csrfdefense=0&xssdefense=4
        <br>
        Submit: csrf_0.html
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        <b>Token validation</b>
        <br>
        The server sets a cookie named <code>csrf_token</code> to a random 16-byte value and also includes this value as
        a hidden field in the login form. When the form is submitted, the server verifies that the client’s cookie
        matches the value in the form. You are allowed to exploit the <code>XSS</code> vulnerability from Part 3 to
        accomplish your goal.
        <br>
        Target: https://elecos432.org/login?csrfdefense=1&xssdefense=0
        <br>
        Submit: csrf_1.html
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li><b>Token validation, without XSS [Extra credit]</b>
        <br>
        Accomplish the same task as above (<b>Token validation</b>) without using XSS.
        <br>
        Target: https://elecos432.org/login?csrfdefense=1&xssdefense=4
        <br>
        Submit: csrf_2.html
        <br>
        This challenge is hard. We think it requires finding a 0-day vulnerability or an unintentional bug in our code.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <b>What to submit</b> For each part, submit an HTML file with the given name that accomplishes the
      specified attack against the specified target URL. <b>Please remember to correctly specify the CSRF defense levels
        in the URLs.</b> The HTML files you submit may embed inline
      JavaScript and load jQuery from the URL:

      <p style="margin-left: 40px"><code>http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js</code></p>

      It is also permissible to load the jQuery cookies library from the URL:
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        <code>https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-cookie/1.4.1/jquery.cookie.min.js</code></p>

      Otherwise, your code must be self contained.
      <p></p>

      <p>Test your solutions by opening them as local files in the browser in the Linux VM. Note: Since you’re sharing
        the attacker account with other students, we’ve hard-coded it so the search history won’t actually update. You
        can test with a different account you create to see the history change.</p>

    </ul>
    <h5 class="mt-5">Part 3. Cross-site Scripting (XSS)</h5>
    <p>
      Your final goal is to demonstrate XSS attacks against the <b>BUNGLE!</b> search box, which does not
      properly filter search terms before echoing them to the results page. For each of the defenses
      below, your goal is to construct a URL that, when loaded in the victim’s browser, correctly executes
      the specified payload. We recommend that you begin by testing with a simple payload (e.g.,
      <code>alert(0);</code>), then move on to the full payload. Note that you should be able to implement the
      payload once, then use different means of encoding it to bypass the different defenses.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Payload</b> The payload (the code that the attack tries to execute) will be to steal the username and the most
      recent search the real user has performed on the <b>BUNGLE!</b> site. When a victim visits the URL you
      create, these stolen items should be sent to the attacker’s server for collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      For purposes of grading, your attack should report these events by loading the URL:</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px"><code>http://localhost:31337/stolen?user=username&last_search=last_search</code></p>
    <p>You can test receiving this data within the provided VM by downloading</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px"><code> <a href="log_listener.py" download>log_listener.py</a></code></p> and running
    these commands in terminal:
    <p></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px"><code>$ cd /Downloads; python log_listener.py</code></p>
    <p>
      and observing the HTTP GET request that your payload generates. To further test that your HTTP
      server is running, try navigating to:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px"><code>http://localhost:31337</code></p>
    <p><b>Defenses</b> There are five levels of defense. In each case, you should submit the simplest attack you can
      find that works against that defense; you should not simply attack the highest level and submit your solution for
      that level for every level. Try to use a different technique for each defense. The Python code that implements
      each defense is shown below, along with the target URL and the filename you should submit.</p>

    <ol start="0">
      <li>
        <b>No defenses</b>
        <br>
        Target: <a href="https://elecos432.org/search?xssdefense=0">https://elecos432.org/search?xssdefense=0</a>
        <br>
        Submit: xss_0.txt
        <br>

        <b>What to submit</b> Your submission for each level of defense will be a text file with the specified filename
        that contains a single line consisting of a URL. When this URL is loaded in a victim’s
        browser, it should execute the specified payload against the specified target. <b>Please remember to correctly
          specify the XSS defense levels in your URLs (if you have nested URLs, specify the levels in the nested ones
          too!). </b>

        The payload encoded in
        your URLs may embed inline JavaScript and load jQuery from the URL:
      <p style="margin-left: 40px"><code>http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js</code></p>

      It is also permissible to load the jQuery cookies library from the URL:

      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        <code>https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-cookie/1.4.1/jquery.cookie.min.js</code></p>
      Otherwise, your code must be self contained. Test your solutions with the browser in the Linux VM.


      </p>

    </ol>
    <h5 class="mt-5">Part 4. Writeup: Better Defenses</h5>
    <p>For each of the three kinds of attacks (SQL injection, CSRF, and XSS), write a paragraph of advice
      for the <b>BUNGLE!</b> developers recommending what techniques they should use to defend themselves. </p>
    <p>
      <b>What to submit</b> A text file named <code>writeup.txt</code> containing your security recommendations.


    <h5 class="mt-5">Submission Checklist</h5>
    <p>Where applicable, your solutions may contain embedded JavaScript. They are allowed to load only the exact
      Javascript libraries specified above, and must be otherwise self-contained. Test your solutions with the browser
      provided in the VM.</p>
    <p>The solutions you submit for Part 2 (CSRF) and Part 3 (XSS) must include the <code>csrfdefense=n</code> or
      <code>xssdefense=n</code> parameter in the target URL, as specified in each task. You may not attempt to subvert
      the mechanism for changing the level of defense in your attacks. Submit your files as a single zip file on <a
        href="https://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>. Your zip file should have the following structure:</p>
